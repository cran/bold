bold: A programmatic interface to the Barcode of Life data.
}
\section{About}{


This package gives you access to data from BOLD System \url{http://www.boldsystems.org/} via
their API.
}

\section{Functions}{


There are currently six functions.

\itemize{
 \item bold_specimens - Search for specimen data.
 \item bold_seq - Search for and retrieve sequences.
 \item bold_seqspec - Get sequence and specimen data together.
 \item bold_trace - Get trace files.
 \item bold_tax_name - Get taxonomic names via input names.
 \item bold_tax_id - Get taxonomic names via BOLD identifiers.
}

Interestingly, they provide xml and tsv format data for the specimen data, while they provide
fasta data format for the sequence data. So for the specimen data you can get back raw XML, or
a data frame parsed from the tsv data, while for sequence data you get back a list (b/c
sequences are quite long and would make a data frame unwieldy).
