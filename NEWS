bold 0.2.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Package gains two new functions for working with the BOLD taxonomy APIs: `bold_tax_name()` and `bold_tax_id()`, which search for taxonomic data from BOLD using either names or BOLD identifiers, respectively. (#11)
* Two new packages in Imports: `jsonlite` and `reshape`.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added new taxonomy API functions to the vignette (#14)
* Added reference URLS to all function doc files to allow easy reference for the appropriate API docs.
* `callopts` parameter changed to `...` throughout the package, so that passing on options to `httr::GET` is done via named parameters, e.g., `config=verbose()`. (#13)
* Added examples of doing curl debugging throughout man pages.
